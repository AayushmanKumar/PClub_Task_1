Aadit and Aalekh were getting bored in the summer and they decided to play a game with arrays !
Each player would take turns and would take **atleast one or more** elements of the array from any ends of the array.
The game ends when the array is empty and all the elements have been taken by Aadit and Aalekh.

Aadit convinces to Aalekh that he would take the first chance unbeknownst to Aalekh that whoever starts the game can never lose !
Both Aadit and Aalekh now play the game multiple times with different test cases and both of them play optimally.
Both of them play optimally and after the end of a game they ask you to keep track of the **difference with which Aadit wins**.
It is clear that Aadit wants to maximise the difference while Aalekh wants to minimise it.

## Input
The first line of the input contains $$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$ -- the number of test cases.
